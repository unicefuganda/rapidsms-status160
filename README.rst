Status160
---------
Status160 is an emergency response system designed to alleviate the demands of a calling tree in an emergency situation: staff members who are safe and able to send an SMS can respond to a status survey with 'YES' indicate that they needn't be contacted, allowing emergency reponders to devote time to those whose status is unknown.  Status160 can also send SMS alerts to wardens with charges who are unsafe/unknown.

Status160 provides a basic dashboard view for managing contacts.

Installation
------------
Status160 can be installed from a terminal using pip install -e git+http://github.com/daveycrockett/rapidsms-status160#egg=status160
